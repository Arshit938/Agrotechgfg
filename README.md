-> it is a web based application which make use of different apis to tell the current price of crop according to diffrent state
-> it helps dealers to bid online to reduce paperwork
-> it also gives an estimated quality for crop when given certain features

#how will it work
-> farmer will be given a form to fill in that form they have to upload the images of crop a video
-> in that form they will fill the type of crop then crop name and its features for quality
-> they will also set a base price for their crop

-> dealer will have detail of all the crop which are on sale and can bid accordingly
-> after farmer think the highest bid is ok for him or bid reached the max range the bidder will get the deal
-> after deal is set they can talk to each other about the transporation and stuff
-> both farmer and dealer have to pay application charges to reduce the chances of fake profiles
